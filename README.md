# UnsupervisedLearning-Basic-projects

Unsupervised learning is the training of machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns and differences without any prior training of data.

Unlike supervised learning, no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the machine. Therefore machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by our-self.

# Algorithms

There are many unsupervised learning alorithm that are used .And some of the cmmonly used algorithms are:

1. Kmeans Clustering

2. Density based clustering

3. Mixture Models

4. PCA ( principal compnent analysis )

5. ICA (Independemt Component Analysis )
