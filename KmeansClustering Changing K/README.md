#INTRODUCTION

K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided. Data points are clustered based on feature similarity. The results of the K-means clustering algorithm are:

1.The centroids of the K clusters, which can be used to label new data

2.Labels for the training data (each data point is assigned to a single cluster)

3.Rather than defining groups before looking at the data, clustering allows you to find and analyze the groups that have formed organically. The "Choosing K" section below describes how the number of groups can be determined.  





And in this repository we have shown what effects does it have when changing the number of clusters formed on the same set of data.
